            card. You may not impersonate any participant or use another
            participant&#39;s password(s). Such fraudulent conduct is a
            violation of federal and state laws. Fraudulent conduct may be

            GROUNDS FOR TERMINATION OF SERVICE
          </Typography>
          <Typography component='p'>
            As a seller on Tinkoko Market Place, it is imperative that your
            policies are in tandem with Tinkoko’s policies where customer
            satisfaction and customer experience is required. The right to
            immediate termination in particular covers a case where the Seller
            repeatedly receives negative ratings and reviews on the website, and
            when these are not obviously unjustified.
          </Typography>
          <Typography component='p'>
            Repeatedly providing misleading information or withholding
            information required presenting the Seller&#39;s items is also
            grounds for immediate termination. Typos, mistakes and transmission
            errors are excluded from this, as long as they are not caused with
            intent or by gross negligence. To this end, we have outline grounds
            for which a seller’s account will be discontinued.

            Products offered for sale on Tinkoko.com must comply with all laws
            and regulations and with Tinkoko &#39;s policies. The sale of
            illegal, unsafe, or other restricted products listed on these pages,
            including products available only by prescription, is strictly
            prohibited.
          </Typography>

          <Typography component='p'>
            We take product safety and these restrictions very seriously.
            Sellers should carefully review the permitted Product category
            before listing a product. The examples provided in the categories
            are not all-inclusive and are provided solely as an informational
            guide. We encourage you to consult with your legal counsel if you
            have questions about the laws and regulations concerning your
            products. Even where a product is listed as an &quot;Example of
            Permitted Listings,&quot; all products and listings must also comply
            with applicable laws.
          </Typography>
          <Typography component='p'>
            If you sell a Restricted Product, we may immediately suspend or
            terminate your selling privileges and destroy inventory in our
            possession/warehouse without reimbursement. In addition, if we
            determine that a seller&#39;s account has been used to engage in
            illegal activity, remittances and payments may be withheld or
            forfeited. The sale of illegal or unsafe products can also lead to
            legal action, including civil and criminal penalties.
          </Typography>
          <Typography component='p'>
            We are constantly innovating on behalf of our customers and working
            with regulators, third party experts, vendors, and sellers to
            improve the ways we detect and prevent illegal and unsafe products
            from reaching our marketplace. We work hard on this issue every day
